Python provides several built-in data structures that allow developers to store, manipulate, and retrieve data efficiently. These data structures are versatile, easy to use, and form the backbone of many Python programs.

1. List
Definition: An ordered, mutable collection that allows duplicate elements.
Characteristics:
Can store heterogeneous elements (e.g., integers, strings, floats, etc.).
Indexed and can be accessed using zero-based indexing.
Syntax:
python
Copy
Edit
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello", 5.5]
Key Operations:
Access: my_list[0] → 1
Append: my_list.append(6)
Remove: my_list.remove(3)
Slicing: my_list[1:3]
2. Tuple
Definition: An ordered, immutable collection that allows duplicate elements.
Characteristics:
Like lists, but cannot be modified after creation.
Used for fixed collections of items.
Syntax:
python
Copy
Edit
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "hello", 5.5)
Key Operations:
Access: my_tuple[0] → 1
Slicing: my_tuple[1:3]
Unpacking: a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)
3. Set
Definition: An unordered, mutable collection of unique elements.
Characteristics:
No duplicates allowed.
Commonly used for membership testing and eliminating duplicates.
Syntax:
python
Copy
Edit
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}  # Results in {1, 2, 3, 4}
Key Operations:
Add: my_set.add(5)
Remove: my_set.remove(3)
Union: my_set.union({6, 7})
Intersection: my_set.intersection({2, 3, 8})
4. Dictionary
Definition: An unordered, mutable collection of key-value pairs.
Characteristics:
Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
Values can be of any type and are mutable.
Syntax:
python
Copy
Edit
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
Key Operations:
Access: my_dict["name"] → "Alice"
Add/Update: my_dict["job"] = "Engineer"
Delete: del my_dict["age"]
Keys: my_dict.keys() → dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'city'])
5. String
Definition: An immutable sequence of characters.
Characteristics:
Strings are treated as a collection of Unicode characters.
Can be indexed and sliced like lists.
Syntax:
python
Copy
Edit
my_string = "hello"
Key Operations:
Access: my_string[1] → 'e'
Slice: my_string[1:4] → 'ell'
Concatenate: "hello" + " world"
Methods: "hello".upper() → "HELLO"


When to Use Which Data Structure
List: When you need a dynamic, ordered collection of items.
Tuple: For fixed, unchanging sequences of data.
Set: To store unique elements and perform set operations like union and intersection.
Dictionary: To map relationships between keys and values, like storing configurations or metadata.
String: For any textual data processing.
These data structures make Python highly flexible and efficient for various programming tasks!
